"cc.calliope.miniplaygroundbook.Inputs.IssuingCommands" ="The rounded corners of the Calliope mini are labeled **-, +, 0, 1, 2 and 3**. 
If you touch the corner labeled **-** with one finger and one of the corners labeled with numbers with another finger, the Calliope mini lets a low electric current flow through your body. Since your body conducts electricity, the Calliope mini recognizes the closed circuit.

By touching pins **0, 1, 2, or 3**, you can also make input for Calliope mini to execute commands. 

* callout(Tip):
Make sure to touch the minus pin (-) with the other hand at the same time.
