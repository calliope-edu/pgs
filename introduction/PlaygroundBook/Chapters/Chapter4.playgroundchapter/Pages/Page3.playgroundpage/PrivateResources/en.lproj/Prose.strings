**Goal:** Assign a tone and a color to each touch pin and off you go!

In the `forever` function, three parameters are assigned to each touch pin: 
the pin number, a note and a color. 
- parameter `pin`: number
- parameter `note`: miniSound
- parameter `color`: miniColor

The function `note` is called again and again in sequence. This function checks whether the respective touch pin is touched or not.

![pianio](chapter_4_2)

Take a closer look at the two functions:

function `forever`
  - Calling the `note` function, passes the parameters for Touch Pin 0.
  - The `note` function checks whether `pin 0` is touched - `io.pin(pin).isPressed`.
  - Now there are two possibilities: 
	  - Condition is fulfilled = TRUE
	  - Condition is not fulfilled = FALSE
  - If the condition is `FALSE`, the `note` function is exited and the next call from the `forever` function is started - `pin 1`.
  - If the condition is `TRUE` , the RGB LED is turned on and the tone is played.
  As long as Touch `pin 0` is touched, the RGB LED lights up and the note is played. Only when `pin 0` is no longer touched, the next command is read and the sound and RGB LED are turned off.
Then the `note` function is exited and the next call from the `forever` function is started - pin 1, pin 2, pin 3.
- This is repeated infinitely often.
