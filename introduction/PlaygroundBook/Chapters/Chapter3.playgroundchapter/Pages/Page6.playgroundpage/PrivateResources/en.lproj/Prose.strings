"cc.calliope.miniplaygroundbook.Inputs.IssuingCommands" ="Loops allow statements to be repeated. Some loops run forever - endless loop. Some go through a certain number of repetitions. Others are executed until a certain condition is fulfilled. You can decide how it makes sense for your program.

**Goal:** Program a timer!

With your timer you can set the start number and the end number yourself. The rest is done in the loop.
In the for loop, the respective number of repetitions is inserted in the variable `i`. The current value `i` is displayed on the LED display each time it is repeated.
With the sleep setting you set the tempo.
How much time should there be between the repetitions?

Read the lines of code and try to understand each command.

1. Use the number block to set the starting number to 0.
2. Enter the number of repetitions using the numeric keypad.
3. Define the tempo by entering an individual value in the sleep statement using the numeric keypad.
4. Tap Run My Code.

* callout(Tip):
You can build your own timer - for example for brushing your teeth.
