"cc.calliope.miniplaygroundbook.Inputs.IssuingCommands" ="A number is randomly selected from a range of numbers you specify. Note, however, that the 0 is counted!

![â€¦](trenner_small)

**Goal:** Program a randomly generated dice.\

The variable `r` stands for random.
When the Calliope mini is shaken, a number from a defined number range is randomly displayed on the LED display.

![chapter_3](chapter_3_random)

Read the lines of code and try to understand each command.

1. Use the number block to define the number range.
2. Tap Run My Code.

Don't forget to shake it :)

![...](idee)

**Idea:** Use the dice and build your own course. Beforehand you and your friends have to determine the individual exercises and rules of the game.
For example, 1 means 10 jumps on one leg, 2 means 5 squats and so on. 
Think of something funny or athletically!
