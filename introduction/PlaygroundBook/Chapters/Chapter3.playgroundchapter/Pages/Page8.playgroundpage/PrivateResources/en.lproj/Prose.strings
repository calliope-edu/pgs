**Goal:** Shake your Calliope mini and get a random number. If a `6` is rolled, run a winning text over the LED display. For all other numbers choose a different text.

When the Calliope mini is shaken, a number from the defined number range is randomly `r` output on the LED display.

Read the lines of code and try to understand each command.

1. Use the number block to define the number range.
2. Use the number block to define the number you want the condition to be true.
3. Tap `String` to enter the individual text.
4. Tap Run My Code.

Don't forget to shake it :)
